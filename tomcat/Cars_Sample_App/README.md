# Cars Sample App Readme

Original repository for this code is from https://github.com/Appdynamics/Cars_Sample_App/tree/1.0-MAINTENANCE

This is a simple Struts 1 app which provides for a Super car store which has a couple of performance/code issues. The app can be built with Maven.

## Database

The app uses a MySQL DB in the backend, this be default is expected to be the "supercars" schema, and MySQL running locally to the app. The schema build is in src/main/resources/db/mysql.sql. Execute this script against the schema you create in MySQL. Note this does not populate the cars table by default, so there will be no cars in the DB initially.

The datasouce is defined in context.xml in src/webapp/META-INF
